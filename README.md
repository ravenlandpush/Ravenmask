Ethereum is an open source blockchain based distributed-computing platform which features a scripting smart contract functionality. Ethereum uses a slightly modified version of the Nakamato consensus to provide it's utility. 

Ravencoin is an open source blockchain fork of the bitcoin ledger, which differs somewhat from ethereum lacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM); ravencoin then operates with an unmodified consnesus of the bitcoin ledger, except that it has support for electronicized tokens, within it, which bitcoin does not have.  The ravencoin asset layer allows users to own asset tokens within their ravencoin (fork of bitcoin). The ravencoin wallets asset functions work in a similar and much more user accessible manner when compared to Ethereums ERC20, except for a lack of some functions which EVM provides allowing for automated contractual trust to be made between two parties, such as 4 ETH for 4000 MEDICI tokens. 

On the ravencoin network it is largely dependent on the trustworthiness of the party, and a 'proof of promise' can be exchanged within the respective ledger using the newly added ravencoin asset layer.

One existing problem with Ravencoin is that its lack of an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and a lack of a scripting language natively within the execution of the chain, make it more difficult to create an autonomous contract that exists between two parties that can be automatically enforced.

One potential solution to this problem is by creating an application similar to Ethereums 'Metamask', that could sit within the browsers and the ravencoin layer, which could act as basic smartscript mechanism, to allow an execution within asset base for the transactioning of assets between multiple parties. One reasonable though is an autonomous listener, like a burn address, which, instead of when receiving the tokens were inaccesible, were forwarded onto the indicated message, or indicated memo address, that the origining tokens manifested. This would result in an equivalent 'smart contract', or 'autonomy' whereby there is some fundamental guarantee that tokens sent to a specific address via this ravenmask layer, may end up in the correct location. As mentioned previously this may be done via some memo or hash indication, whereby each buyer and seller both indicate the key or ipfs_hash that is relevant to the transaction, and this in turn can be used to programatically create the necesary transaction instructions to the listener. This would involve the creation of another smaller network of nodes, that used a similar or modified version of the ravend software to essentially allow transactions which are in no way connected to eachother by smartscript, to be infact connected by a unique reference that is operable as a transaction on the chain. This may require significant modification however it is hoped thru a community effort that it will be possible to create a protocol or standard of interaction compatible with the existing codebase of ravencoin asset layer, with minimum new functions added to ravencoin. 

For securities to work for issuers the issuers will need certain things:

* They will need to know who their shareholders are in most cases
* They will need to have compliance functions and communications functions
* They will need to be able to communicate with and pay funds to holders
* They will need the ability to revoke the shares 
* They would need to the ability to issue more
* In many cases, especially for many current offerings and STOs, the issuers will need to control who it can transfer to and how â€“ such as through accredited investors and so on.

Although Ravencoin does not have smart contracts, it does have a manner of referencing a unique file object, within such an object, transaction commands could be stored, and, the unique file object could be only conditionally added to the ravencoin chain when 2 parties have acceptably fulfilled certain conditions such as making a payment to a particular address. Naturally the example given is a more centralized programmatic description of the aformentioned, however it is theorized that the same may be possible using completely decentralized principle to achieve the same, with minimal modifications to ravend, and some additional application such as the one proposed - Ravenmask.

When it comes to Ravenmask, A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before it is time. However a man can make a thing happen based on two other things happening at different times. Although ravencoin may not have a smart-face, it has a filesystem, and an json object aware blockchain. Therefore the components necessary exist already, and someone only need modify them to fulfil an enumeration or simulation of ravend for assets. Also support would include pinning IPFS info for metadata and messages. 

The necessary components are there. What Must All Men Do?
